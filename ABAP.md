## ABAP Keyword Documentation

> [ABAP](#abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#abap-keyword-documentation)

No code can be written if we don't know the syntax. So the place to understand syntaxes as well as to see some **examples** is the [**SAP - ABAP Keyword Documentation**](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-us/abenabap.htm)


## Clean ABAP 

> [ABAP](#abap) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#clean-abap)

Whenever we write code, we must ensure the readability and maintainability of that code.
It's not a one-person game where you do a program and never touch it.
Many after us will come and will work on the same code. So we have to ensure that anybody can look at the code, understand what's happening, and then do the required modifications without wasting their time and breaking the program.

For that, we refer to [**Clean ABAP coding**](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md) concepts.
